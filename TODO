+ Add CSS config.
+ Consider running a web service for this instead. Trying to educate a GUI user
  on using command-lines, and worse yet, inside a Windows emulator, is just ...
  too much. Just make it a darned webservice and call it a day.
   * Hooray, arsd.cgi comes to the rescue! It's pretty awesome, like the rest
     of arsd.
+ Implement free translation line.
   + Can just make it an optional last line that contains no tabs (so it won't
     be mistaken for another interlinear line).
+ Implement specification of font face.
